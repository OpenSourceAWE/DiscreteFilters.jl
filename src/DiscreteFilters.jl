    ema_filter(measurement, filtered_value, cut_off_freq, dt)

An exponential moving average (EMA), also known as an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA),
is a type of infinite impulse response filter that applies weighting factors which decrease exponentially.
The weighting for each older datum decreases exponentially, never reaching zero.

# Arguments
- `measurement`: The measurement value
- `cut_off_freq`: The cut off frequency in Hz
- `dt`: The sampling time (h) in seconds

# Returns
- The filtered value
